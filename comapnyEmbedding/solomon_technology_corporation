Solomon Systech Hosts USI Technical Working Group
Gathering 13 key industry players for the first time in Hong Kong

	 (Hong Kong – 29 Jan 2018) Solomon Systech Limited ("Solomon Systech") is pleased to have hosted the Technical Working Group workshop meeting of USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) in Hong Kong. This face-to-face meeting of USI, took place for the first time in Hong Kong from 12th to 13th December 2017, was attended by 13 companies with representatives from around the globe, including international brands like Google LLC, Intel Corporation, Lenovo, Sharp Corporation, etc.

	 

	The USI Stylus and Device Specification 1.0 (the Specification), which is the first industry standard and a non-proprietary, cross-device active stylus protocol launched in 2016, helps enable the OEM, IHV and software ecosystem to develop a new generation of active styluses that provide consumers a consistent, customizable and interoperable experience across make, model and form-factor. The Specification can be implemented on a wide range of touch-enabled devices, and enables new usages for active styluses, such as multiple styluses operating simultaneously on a single device.

	 

	At the workshop meeting, the USI Technical Working Group has completed the first errata document containing changes that apply to the Specification.  

	 

	Along with touch-enabled devices witnessing high growth, the scope of usage of active stylus devices has also gained momentum. USI technology will enable interoperable communication between an active stylus and touch-enabled devices, allowing consumers to seamlessly write or draw on different devices with one high-quality stylus. According to the Global Stylus Pen Market 2016-2020 report, a significant trend gaining prominence in this market is the extensive application of USI, which is fuelling the adoption of stylus pens. APAC is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the stylus pens market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% by 2020.

	 

	In recent years, the active pen industry landscape has changed dramatically. Companies actively working on active pens has increased from 60 companies in 2014 to over 120 companies in 2017*.

	 

	Richard Kerslake-Smith, Secretary of USI and Product Director of Solomon Systech (UK) Limited, said, "Solomon Systech has been highly committed to innovation and industry collaborations. We are pleased to have the opportunity to host this USI Technical Working Group workshop meeting. We shall continue to contribute to the success of this important industry protocol."

 Microsoft Dynamics SL Connector
Microsoft Dynamics SL is one of Microsoft’s enterprise resource planning software products for project-driven small- and medium-sized enterprises. It is part of the Microsoft Dynamics product family.
Microsoft Dynamics SL has project-based ERP with a connection to Microsoft Office Project Server, a member of the Microsoft Office family. This business management system provides project-, service-, and distribution-driven businesses with project management and project accounting functionality to help organizations manage projects .[citation needed] The functionality includes finance, project accounting, manufacturing, field services, supply chain management, analytics, and electronic commerce.

Project-based ERP Industry Features[edit]
Microsoft Dynamics SL supports budgeting and cost forecasting, time and expense entry, complex allocations, unlimited billing formats, change order control, contract administration, local and Web-based project analysis, employee utilization/realization, proactive alerts, and workflow.

 Microsoft Dynamics SL Business Analytics
Microsoft Dynamics SL provides government contractors with functionality to assist with Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit requirements.[citation needed]
In the construction industry, Microsoft Dynamics SL provides general contractors and residential homebuilders with project management, job cost, materials management, service call entry, receiving, billing, and sales capabilities to allow the management of complex job sites while lowering costs, reducing project delays, and improving customer service.[citation needed]
Microsoft Dynamics SL provides distribution-focused organizations with inventory, receiving, billing, and sales solutions.  The functionality is designed to help organizations reduce distribution costs and inventory, and streamline processes while improving customer service.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Based in Findlay, Ohio, Solomon's roots go back more than 35 years, when co-founders Gary Harpst, Jack Ridge and Vernon Strong started TLB, Inc. in 1980. TLB, Inc. stands for The Lord's Business. TLB was named to remind the founders why the business was started: to conduct the business according to biblical principles. TLB was later renamed Solomon Software, and then Microsoft Dynamics SL,[1]
In April 1999, Solomon Software refocused the product on an all Microsoft technology strategy: Microsoft SQL Server as the database technology; Visual Basic as the software language; and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as the customization language.
Solomon was acquired by Great Plains Software in June 2000. Great Plains was subsequently acquired by Microsoft Corporation in May 2001.
The newest[when?] version is Microsoft Dynamics SL 9.0  (now Dynamics SL 2015[2]), which extends the reach of business information with Microsoft SQL Server business intelligence technology to improve collaboration, reporting, and analysis.[citation needed]

† Offer Details: Offer expires September 30, 2018. Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied. Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
