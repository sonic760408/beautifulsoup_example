Markus Mergens
”This big “ESD family” is rich with great technical experts as well as wonderful, diverse people.”
Markus received his Diploma in Physics in 1996 from Aachen University of Technology (RWTH) in Germany with a major in solid state and laser physics. In 2001, he was granted a PhD in Technical Sciences from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ), Switzerland for his work on device-/circuit-level simulation of automotive high-voltage ESD protection performed at Robert Bosch GmbH, Reutlingen. From 2000 to 2005, Markus worked for Sarnoff Corporation/Europe in Princeton NJ, USA and Belgium as project leader in multiple ESD development projects for the world-wide semiconductor industry. In 2005, Markus joined Infineon Technologies in the automotive technology department, where he was responsible for the device team and ESD for PROFETS. In 2007, Markus founded QPX GmbH, a service provider for ESD development, ESD product integration, consulting and training. QPX customers range from IDMs, foundries and fabless design houses being based in Europe, Japan, and USA. QPX focus is on high-voltage ESD technology including automotive system-level requirements. Markus holds more than 30 journal / conference presentations and 18 patents.
Living in the suburbs of Munich, Markus and his wife Sibylle have two sons, Tom (8) and Matteo (4). Markus loves spending his time out in nature with his family and friends, hiking in the mountains, romping in the snow with the kids, swimming in salty water, or just running thru the local forest. He is fond of soccer (his active career is over for quite some time though) and skiing the Alps. He also likes playing golf although his game has not really improved dramatically. The latter is owed to the fact that loving a family and taking care of ESD customers does not really leave so much room for time consuming activities.
Despite this, Markus has always enjoyed spending time in the ESDA community and has been a member of ESDA since 1998. The EOS/ESD Symposium and the IEW have been a substantial part of his professional career and personal growth. Attendance is still quite a learning experience keeping him up to date with the latest trends. Moreover, this big “ESD family” is rich of great technical experts as well as wonderful, diverse people – some of them became friends during fruitful exchanges and cooperation over the past years. Markus is grateful to have the privilege serving in the EOS/ESD TPC many times since 2001 (two times in the position of subcommittee chair) and the IEW management committee since 2008 (TPC chair in 2011). He received the best presentation award from the Symposium in 2001. Big Thank-You, ESDA!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Open section Q-Cables_Chambers_Accessories(PDF) to view related products. (Opens in a new tab)PTW 34045, Advanced Markus® Electron Chamber.The Advanced Markus features a wide guard ring design to avoid perturbation effects by reducing the influence of scattered radiation from the housing.  Since the outer shape is identical with the Markus chamber, all existing Markus chamber phantom plates and adapters can be used with the Advanced Markus chamber.  The small sensitive volume makes the chamber ideal for dose distribution measurements in a water phantom, giving a good spatial resolution.  The chamber features a flat energy response within the nominal energy range from 2 MeV to 45 MeV.  With the very thin membrane of only 0.03 mm polyethylene, the chamber is suitable for use in solid state phantoms.  The chamber comes with a protective acrylic cover of 0.87 mm thickness (1 mm water equivalence) for use in water.  A calibration certificate with a 60Co calibration factor given in absorbed dose to water is included.  Air density correction is required for each measurement.  The chamber cable length is 1.05 m.  • Perturbation-free electron chamber
• Thin entrance window and waterproof protection cap
• Small-sized for high spatial resolution
• Sensitive volume 0.02 cm3, vented to air
• Suitable for relative and absolute electron dosimetry  Perturbation-free version of the famous classic Markus chamber for absolute dosimetry in high-energy electron beams.Specifications Type of Product:  vented plane parallel ionization chamber Application:  absolute dosimetry in high-energy electron beams Measuring Quantities:  absorbed dose to water Reference Radiation Quality:  60Co Nominal Sensitive Volume:  0.02 cm3 Design:  Waterproof with protection cap, vented Reference Point:  in chamber center on entrance foil, or 1.3 mm below surface of protection cap Direction of Incidence:  perpendicular to chamber plane Nominal Response:  0.67 nC/Gy Long-term Stability:  ≤ 1% per year Chamber Voltage:  300 V nominal ±400 V maximal Polarity Effect:  ≤ 1% for electrons ≤ 9 MeV Directional Response in Water:  ≤± 0.1% for chamber tilting ≤± 10° Leakage Current:  ≤ ± 4 fA Cable Leakage:  ≤ 1 pC/(Gy∙cm)
