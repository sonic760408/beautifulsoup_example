History[edit]
The company was founded by Alan Farnell and Arthur Woffenden in 1939 in Leeds under the name of A.C. Farnell Limited.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1966.[4] The company was located next to the Wetherby railway station: as it grew it moved into larger offices on the town's Sandbeck Industrial Estate, and then in 1995, into offices in Armley.[5]
In 1995 it acquired Combined Precision Components.[6] As it focused on distribution, its manufacturing operations were sold the same year.[4] In 1996 it went on to buy the Premier Industrial Corporation, a leading United States distributor,[7] and in doing so changed its name to Premier Farnell.[4]
In 2001 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Buck & Hickman,[8] a company which it subsequently went on to sell in 2007.[9] Premier Farnell announced in 2006 the completed sale of Kent, its specialist automotive consumables business.[10]
The company underwent significant change in the mid-2000s, developing from a catalogues and trade counter business into an e-commerce operation, under the direction of Harriet Green, CEO, who joined the business in 2006.[11][12]
In 2007 the group launched its Greater China business, Premier Electronics, with the opening of a new warehouse and distribution centre in WaiGaoQiao.[13]
Towards the end of 2008 Premier Farnell began the closure of Cadillac Electric (part of the group's Industrial Products Division).[14] During the course of 2008 Premier Farnell also acquired Hynetic Electronics,[15] an Indian distributor, and in early 2009 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Microdis Electronics, an electronics distributor based in Poland.[16]
On 24 September 2009, it announced the acquisition of CadSoft Computer GmbH, developer of EAGLE electronic design automation software,[17] which it later sold in 2016.[18]
On 17 March 2016, Premier Farnell sold its Akron Brass subsidiary to IDEX Corporation for $224.2 million.[19]
On 17 October 2016, Avnet completed its  acquisition of Premier Farnell in a deal valued at approximately Â£691 million.[3]

With shifting demands and expectations, are todayâs distributors fit for purpose?Author : Ralf Buehler, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer for Premier Farnell17 August 2017Distributors play a vital role in keeping the electronics industry moving, providing essential supplies and support. Over theÂ past five Â years, engineers and businesses that rely on distributors have seen customer needs change radically â promptingÂ shifts in buying behaviour that have resulted in a knock-on effect all the way up the supply chain and back again.This article originally appeared in the July 2017 issue of Electronic Product Design & Test; to viewÂ the digital edition,Â click hereÂ â and to register to receiveÂ your own printed copy,Â click here.CustomersÂ and buyers are more clued up than ever, and not afraid to shop around, and distributors face the challenge of meeting theseÂ changing needs. This article from Premier Farnell discusses how distributorsÂ have to adapt to best serve customer needs in a rapidly shifting competitive landscape.The rapid surge in connected devices and miniaturisedÂ wearables has driven growth in the burgeoning InternetÂ of Things (IoT) sector, with professional makers at theÂ cutting edge of this growth. IoT is one of the most excitingÂ and accessible markets for electronics design engineers,Â opening up opportunities to bring new products to market andÂ address a broader range of unique customer needs than everÂ before. In addition to traditional market entrants, who haveÂ experience in bringing products to market, there is now a newÂ customer group: makers who may be bringing a product toÂ market for the first time. Makers value support with volumeÂ production, which includes careful management of inventoryÂ and obsolescence (differentiating them from traditionalÂ hobbyists), and have a greater need for technical support.The challenge of going whereÂ no one has gone beforeThe rapid development of the IoT space, and growth in areas such as 3D printing and wearables, is driving designers of allÂ experience levels to tackle new challenges as they enter new markets and applyÂ technology in ways it has not been usedÂ before. This could mean negotiatingÂ compliance challenges within heavily regulatedÂ industries like healthcare and automotive, orÂ developing deeper knowledge of existingÂ technology as it is applied in novel andÂ different ways, such as harsher environmentsÂ or within flexible applications, like clothing.The pressure to keep up is keenly felt byÂ design engineers and there is a growing trendÂ to work with distributors that can support themÂ right from the beginning with research andÂ design expertise â as well as provide broadÂ product portfolios, high volume distributionÂ and supply chain support, logistics, financeÂ and excellent customer service.In order to better service engineers, makersÂ and hobbyists, distributors have focusedÂ attention on their web presence, to attract newÂ customers as well as support existing ones.Â With the overwhelming majority of productsÂ now available online, distributor websitesÂ need to balance easy navigation and searchÂ functionality with deep technical informationÂ and support resources to retain customers and reach new audiences.Bearing all of these factors in mind, and theÂ distinct, but overlapping, needs of the marketplace, is it possible for a distributor to keep allÂ customers happy? Or, is it better to choose oneÂ target customer group and focus on them alone?Â A new breed of distributor2016 saw two of the worldâs most well-knownÂ distributors join forces, when Avnet acquiredÂ Premier Farnell. The combination bringsÂ together two companies to create a uniqueÂ technology distribution business that aims toÂ better serve both professional design engineersÂ and the maker and hobbyist markets.Â Premier Farnell specialises in helpingÂ customers move from product idea and design through to prototype and low volumeÂ manufacturing. Its customer base ranges from hobbyists through to design engineers and professional makers. As the leadingÂ manufacturer and distributor of Raspberry Pi,Â exclusive manufacturer of BBC micro:bit andÂ an official manufacturer of BeagleBone Black, itÂ manufactures many of the products it supplies.Avnet is a global high-volume-orientedÂ franchise distributor with deep expertise inÂ broadline distribution and world-class globalÂ logistics and supply chain management. Joining forces creates a new breed ofÂ distributor that offers better support at allÂ stages of the product development process,Â from design through to volume manufacturingÂ and product lifecycle management â providingÂ a seamless service for all types of customers.Premier Farnell is experienced at working withÂ customers from early stage design and helpingÂ them take their ideas to production â from initialÂ support via 200 in-house design engineers to optimising the product for production andÂ leveraging manufacturing capabilities, rightÂ through to ongoing test and maintenance viaÂ its bench-to-board offering. Now, as part of theÂ Avnet family, it can draw on Avnetâs expertise inÂ high volume production to support customersÂ at every stage of their journey. The combinationÂ of Avnet and Premier Farnell is not aboutÂ crunching together two businesses looking forÂ opportunities to drive out costs, but looking forÂ synergies that enable them to serve customersÂ better and provide a truly holistic solution.The combination of Avnet and Premier FarnellÂ aims to offer the heavyweight resourcesÂ needed by large manufacturers, along with theÂ finer touch to work with inventors, makers andÂ design engineers to help them turn their ideasÂ into prototypes. Itâs the ability to engage withÂ innovators at the earliest stages of productÂ design and development that will fuel a newÂ chapter of growth for the industry.Todayâs customers demand the best of bothÂ worlds: to work with companies with the scale,Â size and global reach of a broadline business,Â while still offering the specialised capabilities toÂ serve them through all stages of the productÂ lifecycle. From assessing market needs andÂ customer requirements, we believe that theÂ combination of Premier Farnell and Avnet offersÂ benefits to all its customers, regardless of theirÂ level of experience, turnover or geographicalÂ location â and sets the bar for distributorsÂ worldwide.Â Contact Details and Archive...

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

History[edit]
The company was founded by Alan Farnell and Arthur Woffenden in 1939 in Leeds under the name of A.C. Farnell Limited.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1966.[4] The company was located next to the Wetherby railway station: as it grew it moved into larger offices on the town's Sandbeck Industrial Estate, and then in 1995, into offices in Armley.[5]
In 1995 it acquired Combined Precision Components.[6] As it focused on distribution, its manufacturing operations were sold the same year.[4] In 1996 it went on to buy the Premier Industrial Corporation, a leading United States distributor,[7] and in doing so changed its name to Premier Farnell.[4]
In 2001 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Buck & Hickman,[8] a company which it subsequently went on to sell in 2007.[9] Premier Farnell announced in 2006 the completed sale of Kent, its specialist automotive consumables business.[10]
The company underwent significant change in the mid-2000s, developing from a catalogues and trade counter business into an e-commerce operation, under the direction of Harriet Green, CEO, who joined the business in 2006.[11][12]
In 2007 the group launched its Greater China business, Premier Electronics, with the opening of a new warehouse and distribution centre in WaiGaoQiao.[13]
Towards the end of 2008 Premier Farnell began the closure of Cadillac Electric (part of the group's Industrial Products Division).[14] During the course of 2008 Premier Farnell also acquired Hynetic Electronics,[15] an Indian distributor, and in early 2009 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Microdis Electronics, an electronics distributor based in Poland.[16]
On 24 September 2009, it announced the acquisition of CadSoft Computer GmbH, developer of EAGLE electronic design automation software,[17] which it later sold in 2016.[18]
On 17 March 2016, Premier Farnell sold its Akron Brass subsidiary to IDEX Corporation for $224.2 million.[19]
On 17 October 2016, Avnet completed its  acquisition of Premier Farnell in a deal valued at approximately Â£691 million.[3]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Alan Farnell and Arthur Woffenden in 1939 in Leeds under the name of A.C. Farnell Limited.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1966.[4] The company was located next to the Wetherby railway station: as it grew it moved into larger offices on the town's Sandbeck Industrial Estate, and then in 1995, into offices in Armley.[5]
In 1995 it acquired Combined Precision Components.[6] As it focused on distribution, its manufacturing operations were sold the same year.[4] In 1996 it went on to buy the Premier Industrial Corporation, a leading United States distributor,[7] and in doing so changed its name to Premier Farnell.[4]
In 2001 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Buck & Hickman,[8] a company which it subsequently went on to sell in 2007.[9] Premier Farnell announced in 2006 the completed sale of Kent, its specialist automotive consumables business.[10]
The company underwent significant change in the mid-2000s, developing from a catalogues and trade counter business into an e-commerce operation, under the direction of Harriet Green, CEO, who joined the business in 2006.[11][12]
In 2007 the group launched its Greater China business, Premier Electronics, with the opening of a new warehouse and distribution centre in WaiGaoQiao.[13]
Towards the end of 2008 Premier Farnell began the closure of Cadillac Electric (part of the group's Industrial Products Division).[14] During the course of 2008 Premier Farnell also acquired Hynetic Electronics,[15] an Indian distributor, and in early 2009 Premier Farnell went on to acquire Microdis Electronics, an electronics distributor based in Poland.[16]
On 24 September 2009, it announced the acquisition of CadSoft Computer GmbH, developer of EAGLE electronic design automation software,[17] which it later sold in 2016.[18]
On 17 March 2016, Premier Farnell sold its Akron Brass subsidiary to IDEX Corporation for $224.2 million.[19]
On 17 October 2016, Avnet completed its  acquisition of Premier Farnell in a deal valued at approximately Â£691 million.[3]
